    notes: This dataset (78 taxa, 212 loci) is referred to as the 'primary' dataset in the ms, and forms the basis of Figure 2 in the ms. This is the nucleotide dataset (212_78_MB_aa.nex) taken from the 'supplementary mrbayes files' link in the Dryad repository (http://datadryad.org/bitstream/handle/10255/dryad.107232/supplementarymrbayesfiles.zip?sequence=1). There is a nucleotide (1st and 2nd positions only) version of this dataset stored in this repository as Cannon_2016a.
