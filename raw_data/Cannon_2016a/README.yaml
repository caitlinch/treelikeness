    notes: This dataset (78 taxa, 212 loci) is referred to as the 'primary' dataset in the ms, and forms the basis of Figure 2 in the ms. This is the nucleotide dataset (212_78_MB_nuc.nex) taken from the 'supplementary mrbayes files' link in the Dryad repository (http://datadryad.org/bitstream/handle/10255/dryad.107232/supplementarymrbayesfiles.zip?sequence=1). CHARSETS were added according to the CHARSETS from the protein version of this dataset, which is stored in this repository as Cannon_2016b.
